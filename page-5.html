    <p class="tekst-left">Sofie Gagelmans (1995, Antwerp, Belgium) graduated
         during the fall of 2017 with a master’s degree in graphic
         design from
     <em>LUCA School of Arts</em> in
     <em>Ghent</em>. She received the
         jury prize for her master’s project and graduated with great
         honor. This webpage gives you an overview of her selected
         work and some various projects throughout her years as a
         student. Alongside to this, she tries to be on the lookout for
         new opportunities, individual assignments or collaborations
         with artists. Mainly operating in the field of printed matter,
         brand identities, posters, books and web design. Recently,
         some of her more current designs were selected and shown
         at different exhibitions last year. Her work was a part of the
         “Week of Design” in
     <em>Kortrijk</em> and of the “LUCA Showcase” in
     <em>Ghent</em>. Feel free to contact her for more information,
         questions or collaborations.

    <p class="tekst-right">A redesign for a weekly, Belgian magazine has resulted in a
         newspaper for adults and children. Every article has some
         letter drawings, so while someone is reading the content,
         someone else can draw the image. A system that endures
         throughout the entire newspaper.
