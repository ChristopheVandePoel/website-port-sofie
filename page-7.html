    <p class="tekst-right">A serie of posters designed for a course that was held at
     <em>Sint-Lucas</em> in
     <em>Ghent</em>, with the support of
     <em>Research Unit Image</em>,
     <em>Cinema Sphinx</em>,
     <em>CAMPO</em> and
     <em>019</em>. The lectures were
     a platform for social discussion, readings and documentary
     cinema. The posters are based upon the written documents
     that every speaker writes and memorizes before standing in
     front of an audience.
