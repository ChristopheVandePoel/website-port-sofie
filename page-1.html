    <p class="tekst-left">Sofie Gagelmans (1995, Antwerp, Belgium) graduated
         during the fall of 2017 with a master’s degree in graphic
         design from
     <em>LUCA School of Arts</em> in
     <em>Ghent</em>. She received the
         jury prize for her master’s project and graduated with great
         honor. This webpage gives you an overview of her selected
         work and some various projects throughout her years as a
         student. Alongside to this, she tries to be on the lookout for
         new opportunities, individual assignments or collaborations
         with artists. Mainly operating in the field of printed matter,
         brand identities, posters, books and web design. Recently,
         some of her more current designs were selected and shown
         at different exhibitions last year. Her work was a part of the
         “Week of Design” in
     <em>Kortrijk</em> and of the “LUCA Showcase” in
     <em>Ghent</em>. Feel free to contact her for more information,
         questions or collaborations.

    <p class="tekst-right">For my master project I developed an online tool about a
         language problem, which shows what dyslectics see when
         they try to read a certain amount of words. By doing so, the
         viewer learns how one experiences a sentence in relation to
         someone else. For the first time someone can grasp what a
         dyslectic has to endure on a daily basis. These characteristic
         can be placed in any difficulty, which means that the viewer
         can visualize their own, specific and personal version of the
         ‘disability’. The project was presented to the jury members
         <em>François Havegeer</em>,
         <em>Harrison</em> and
         <em>Jeroen Wille</em>. After a period of time,
         the designs were published in the online magazine “Flanders DC”.
